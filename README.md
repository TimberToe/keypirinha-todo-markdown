# Keypirinha Plugin: todo-markdown

This is todo-markdown, a plugin for the
[Keypirinha](http://keypirinha.com) launcher.

A plugin to easily add/finish/list todos from a Markdown file.

I use a markdown file to jolt down small todos that don't fit in our ticket system.
Since I use Keypirinha for everything else, why not as as shortcut to my todo list!

Since it is an markdown file it is easy to sync between computers through your cloud storage.
It is easy to read and convert to another format if needed

## Download

**TODO:** indicate where the latest `.keypirinha-package` file can be
downloaded. For example a URL to the `releases` list like:
https://github.com/USERNAME/keypirinha-PACKAGE/releases


## Install

Once the `todo-markdown.keypirinha-package` file is installed,
move it to the `InstalledPackage` folder located at:

* `Keypirinha\portable\Profile\InstalledPackages` in **Portable mode**
* **Or** `%APPDATA%\Keypirinha\InstalledPackages` in **Installed mode** (the
  final path would look like
  `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Keypirinha\InstalledPackages`)


## Usage

You will be able to:
 - Add todos
 - Finish todos
 - Delete
 - List todos

Adds a top catalog item "TODO" where everything else is located.
Search for "todo" and press tab.
Under it you should see your todos and search among them.
If your searchterm doesn't exist the option to create a new todo will be presented.
Manage a specific todo by selecting it and open its actions, default by using tab.
