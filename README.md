# Keypirinha Plugin: todo-markdown

This is todo-markdown, a plugin for the
[Keypirinha](http://keypirinha.com) launcher.

A plugin to easily add/finish/list todos in a Markdown file.

I use a markdown file to jolt down small reminders over the day.
Since I use Keypirinha for everything else, why not as as shortcut to my todo list!

Since it is an markdown file it is easy to sync between computers through your cloud storage.
It is easy to read and convert to another format if needed
