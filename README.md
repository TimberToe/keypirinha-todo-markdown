# Keypirinha Plugin: todo-markdown

**NOTE: I have barely started development and it is far from working**

This is todo-markdown, a plugin for the
[Keypirinha](http://keypirinha.com) launcher.

A plugin to easily add/finish/list todos from a Markdown file.

I use a markdown file to jolt down small todos that don't fit in our ticket system.
Since I use Keypirinha for everything else, why not as as shortcut to my todo list!

Since it is an markdown file it is easy to sync between computers through your cloud storage.
It is easy to read and convert to another format if needed

## Download

**TODO:** indicate where the latest `.keypirinha-package` file can be
downloaded. For example a URL to the `releases` list like:
https://github.com/USERNAME/keypirinha-PACKAGE/releases


## Install

Once the `todo-markdown.keypirinha-package` file is installed,
move it to the `InstalledPackage` folder located at:

* `Keypirinha\portable\Profile\InstalledPackages` in **Portable mode**
* **Or** `%APPDATA%\Keypirinha\InstalledPackages` in **Installed mode** (the
  final path would look like
  `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Keypirinha\InstalledPackages`)


## Usage


You will be able to:
 - Add todos
 - Finish todos
 - List top todos
 - Open the markdown file that stores the todos

**TODO:** list the items, if any, inserted to the Catalog by the plugin(s) of
this package. Some plugins only make suggestions, in which case a description of
what kind of suggestions are to be expected by the user may help.
